# ASP.NET Security training example app

This is a purposely buggy web app, using modern(ish) .NET techniques for education purposes.

NB: DO NOT PUT your organisation at risk by running this application anywhere publicly accessible.
This app should ONLY be run locally or in a private network, and should be removed after use to mitigate the risk.

**The security bugs in this app are serious enough to cause harm to your resources if exploited.**

## Setup 

To set up:
1. check out the solution
2. Ensure you have .NET 8 installed `winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8`
3. Run using the dotnet cli `dotnet run` or `dotnet watch` for hot-reloading

NB: The database runs in-memory just as-needed so no setup is needed

## TODO
* Many of the examples are very contrived. Would be nice to make them more realistic
* More examples of varying difficulties
